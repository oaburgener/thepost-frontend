# The Post

[The Post](https://theprofilepost.herokuapp.com/) hosts sports-related editorial articles where athletes can submit content to be published. Athletes can share their thoughts and experiences, struggles and wins with a community of fellow sports enthusiasts.

The Post is intended to be an addition to [PRO-FILE](http://pro-file.us/#/), a website that connects athletes and teams to foster networking and professional opportunities.
